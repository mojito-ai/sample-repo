                Lightweight Championship bout for the vacant title between former three-time Bellator Lightweight
                World Champion Michael Chandler and Charles Oliveira headlined the event. Former champion Khabib
                Nurmagomedov announced his retirement immediately after defending his title at UFC 254 last October,
                citing his father's death from complications related to COVID-19 in July as the main reason behind
                it. Despite his announcement, the title was never officially vacated as UFC President Dana White said
                several times that he believed Nurmagomedov would still fight again. White finally conceded on March 19
                as he confirmed Nurmagomedov's retirement.</p>
